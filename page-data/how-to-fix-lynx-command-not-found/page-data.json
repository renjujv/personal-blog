I mostly use it for hosting some web apps during testing locally since it’s built in and requires minimal setup.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>However, I recently ran into the following error while trying apachectl command to check the server status.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>renju<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>~<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>$<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> apachectl status\nbin/apachectl: line <span class=\"token number\">95</span>: lynx: <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">command</span> not found</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Now, what is lynx?</h3>\n<p>A quick google search explained that lynx is a utility text-based browser in unix that is used by httpd</p>\n<h2>The quick Solution</h2>\n<p>Anyway, the quick solution is to install lynx in your machine.</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">brew</a> to install it using the below command:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">brew install lynx</code></p>\n<p>And that’s it. apachectl works as expected now.</p>\n<h2>The harder way</h2>\n<p>If you don’t use HomeBrew(I feel bad for you) or if you would prefer mundane tasks, you can also download it from here and install it yourself:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lynx.isc.org/release/\">Lynx – Official Website</a></p>\n<h2>Probable root cause</h2>\n<p>I assume this could have been caused due to me messing around with the brew versions or packages last week. That’s the only recent action I remember of that could have caused this. Lynx might have been a dependency for one of the packages and might have been removed due to brew package uninstallation and cleanup!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to fix: 'lynx: command not found'","date":"June 01, 2021","description":"This article describes an issue I faced while using apachectl for managing Apache server and the steps I did to fix it."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/setting-a-locale-in-mac/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting Locale in Mac"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/change-brew-jenkins-port-macos-m1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Changing the Jenkins port on MacOS"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d7a653dc-c092-5863-86fb-b61249aa4f72","previousPostId":"f752afbd-2a32-56b0-8776-401606619107","nextPostId":"6531a5eb-f546-5daf-abf7-b8dfbf712fd3"}},
